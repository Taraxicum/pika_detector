scikits audiolab 7/30/2015
A bit frustrating to get setup.  I tried a few different things and I think the following is what worked:
(note I already have python 2.7 installed on my windows 7 system)

  1) Download scikits.audiolab-0.11.0-cp27-none-win32.whl 
	(note 32 bit version, I tried 64 bit but I guess since my python is 32bit - though my system is 64bit - the 32 was the correct choice)

  2) Install that .whl file by running:
	pip install scikits.audiolab-0.11.0-cp27-none-win32.whl from the directory the file was in

3) install ffmpeg (trying to get utilities set up to process larger audio files without
loading all into memory at once) - downloaded binary from: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-20150928-git-235381e-win64-static.7z

usage examples at: http://howto-pages.org/ffmpeg/

4) sqlite: download precompiled binaries from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html (both the shell and the dll file).  Extract them to a folder of your choice and add that folder to your path.
